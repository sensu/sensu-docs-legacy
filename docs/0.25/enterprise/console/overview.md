# Sensu Enterprise Dashboard

Sensu Enterprise ships with a dashboard that provides a "single-pane of glass"
for one or more Sensu Enterprise installations. The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard
provides real-time visibility into Sensu Enterprise data including dedicated
views for events, clients, checks, and datacenters (i.e. Sensu Enterprise
installations). The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard also provides mechanisms for
silencing Sensu checks and/or clients, and powerful global search features for
filtering views so users can see just the data that's important to them.

## Objectives

What will be covered in this documentation:

- Configuration of the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard
- How to enable Role-Based Access Controls
- Configuration of Audit Logging
- How to use the global search features (Collections)
