# Sensu Enterprise

## Overview

- [What is Sensu Enterprise?](#what-is-sensu-enterprise)
- [Upgrading to Sensu Enterprise](#upgrading-to-sensu-enterprise)
- [Reference documentation](#reference-documentation)

## What is Sensu Enterprise?

[Sensu Enterprise][1] is a drop-in replacement for Sensu Core (the FREE, open
source version of Sensu), that provides added-value features like [contact
routing][2], several built-in [third-party integrations][3], and more. Sensu
Enterprise also includes FREE annual [training][4] and [enterprise-class
support][5].

We like to think of the distinction between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise as
the difference between a framework and a product. The purpose of this
documentation is to help Sensu Enterprise users configure their installation,
making use of the many third-party integrations and features Sensu Enterprise
has to offer. Sensu Enterprise integrates with third-party tools & services to
provide support for creating/resolving incidents, on-call rotation scheduling,
storing time series data (metrics), relaying events, deregistering sensu-clients
for terminated nodes, and/or notifying contacts via various media.

## Upgrading to Sensu Enterprise

Sensu Enterprise is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Sensu Core
[server][6] and [API][7], so for users who are upgrading to Sensu Enterprise
from Sensu Core, no configuration changes are required to resume – simply
terminate the `sensu-server` and `sensu-api` processes, and start the
`sensu-enterprise` process to resume  operation of Sensu (see the [Sensu Server
and API installation guide][8] for  additional details). However, some
configuration changes may be required to take  advantage of certain third-party
integrations or added-value features (e.g. contact routing). Please refer to the
[Sensu Enterprise reference documentation][9] (below), for more
information.
