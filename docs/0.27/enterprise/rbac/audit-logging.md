# Audit Logging

As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 1.3, Audit Logging is enabled by
default. Audit Logging captures user events in the dashboard such as user
login/logout, and any user "write" actions in the dashboard (i.e. silencing
checks, deleting clients, deleting stashes). Optionally, it is also possible to
log all `HTTP GET` requests (i.e. every view requested by the user, and every
search query performed by the user).

### Example configuration

~~~ shell
"audit": {
  "logfile": "/var/log/sensu/sensu-enterprise-dashboard-audit.log",
  "level": "default"
}
~~~
