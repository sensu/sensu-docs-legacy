## What is a Sensu named aggregate?

Sensu named aggregates are collections of [check results][1], accessible via
the [Aggregates API][2]. Check aggregates make it possible to treat the results
of multiple disparate check results &ndash; executed across multiple disparate
systems &ndash; as a single result.

### When should named aggregates be used?

Check aggregates are extremely useful in dynamic environments and/or
environments that have a reasonable tolerance for failure. Check aggregates
should be used when a service can be considered healthy as long as a minimum
threshold is satisfied (e.g. are at least 5 healthy web servers? are at least
70% of N processes healthy?).

## How do named aggregates work?

Check results are included in an aggregate when a check definition includes the
[`aggregate` definition attribute][3]. Check results that provide an
`"aggregate": "example_aggregate"` are aggregated under the corresponding name
(e.g. `example_aggregate`), effectively capturing multiple check resultsÂ as a
single aggregate.

### Example aggregated check result

Aggregated check results are available from the [Aggregates API][2], via the
`/aggregates/:name` API endpoint. An aggregate check result provides a
set of counters indicating the total number of client members, checks, and
check results collected, with a breakdown of how many results were recorded per
status (i.e. `ok`, `warning`, `critical`, and `unknown`).

~~~ json
{
  "clients": 15,
  "checks": 2,
  "results": {
    "ok": 18,
    "warning": 0,
    "critical": 1,
    "unknown": 0,
    "total": 19,
    "stale": 0
  }
}
~~~

Additional aggregate data is available from the Aggregates API, including Sensu
client members of a named aggregate, and the corresponding checks which are
included in the aggregate:

~~~ shell
$ curl -s http://localhost:4567/aggregates/elasticsearch/clients | jq .
[
  {
    "name": "1-424242",
    "checks": [
      "elasticsearch_service",
      "elasticsearch_cluster_health"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "1-424243",
    "checks": [
      "elasticsearch_service"
    ]
  },
]
~~~

Aggregate data may also be fetched per check that is a member of the named
aggregate, along with the corresponding clients that are producing results for
said check:

~~~ shell
$ curl -s http://localhost:4567/aggregates/elasticsearch/checks | jq .
[
  {
    "name": "elasticsearch_service",
    "clients": [
      "1-424242",
      "i-424243"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "elasticsearch_cluster_health",
    "clients": [
      "1-424242"
    ]
  }
]
~~~

## Aggregate configuration

### Example aggregate definition

The following is an example [check definition][6], a JSON configuration file
located at `/etc/sensu/conf.d/check_aggregate_example.json`.

~~~
{
  "checks": {
    "example_check_aggregate": {
      "command": "do_something.rb -o option",
      "aggregate": "example_aggregate",
      "handle": false
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Aggregate definition specification

_NOTE: aggregates are created via the [`aggregate` Sensu `check` definition
attribute][4]. The configuration example(s) provided above, and the
"specification" provided here are for clarification and convenience only (i.e.
this "specification" is just a subset of the [check definition
specification][5], and not a definition of a distinct Sensu primitive)._

#### Aggregate `check` attributes

`aggregate`
: description
  : Create a named aggregate for the check. Check result data will be
    aggregated and exposed via the [Sensu Aggregates API][2].
: required
  : false
: type
  : String
: default
  : false
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "aggregate": "elasticsearch"
    ~~~

`handle`
: description
  : If events created by the check should be handled.
: required
  : false
: type
  : Boolean
: default
  : true
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "handle": false
    ~~~
    _NOTE: although there are cases when it may be helpful to aggregate check
    results **and** handle individual check results, it is typically recommended
    to set `"handle": false` when aggregating check results, as the [purpose of
    the aggregation][8] should be to act on the state of the aggregated
    result(s) rather than the individual check result(s)._
