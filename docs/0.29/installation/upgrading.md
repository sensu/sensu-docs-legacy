# Upgrading Sensu

Upgrading Sensu is usually a straightforward process. In most cases,
upgrading Sensu and/or Sensu Enterprise only requires upgrading to the
latest package. Certain versions of Sensu may include changes that are
*not backwards compatible* and require additional steps be taken when
upgrading.

## Upgrading from Sensu < 0.27

The following documentation provides steps necessary when upgrading
from a Sensu version < `0.27`.

### Stop Sensu services

The first step when upgrading Sensu from a release prior to 0.27 is
stopping the Sensu services. All instances of `sensu-client`,
`sensu-server` and `sensu-api` **MUST** be stopped before proceeding
with the upgrade process.

For example:

~~~ shell
sudo service sensu-server stop
sudo service sensu-api stop
~~~

Stopping services prior to upgrading from a Sensu version < `0.27`
helps to avoid service management errors related to the transition
from sysv init scripts to systemd unit files on platforms like Debian
8, Ubuntu 16.04 and Centos 7 or newer.

## Upgrading from Sensu < 0.17

The following documentation provides steps necessary when upgrading
from a Sensu version < `0.17`.

### Stop Sensu services

The first step when upgrading Sensu from a release prior to 0.17 is
stopping the Sensu services. All instances of `sensu-server` and
`sensu-api` **MUST** be stopped before proceeding with the upgrade
process.

For example:

~~~ shell
sudo service sensu-server stop
sudo service sensu-api stop
~~~

### Flush Redis

Sensu releases newer than 0.16 use a different Redis data structure,
requiring Redis data to be flushed before upgrading.

The Redis CLI tool (`redis-cli`) can be used to issue the Redis
command to flush the data currently stored in redis. Please run the
following commands on your Redis server.

_NOTE: If your Redis server uses a password (`requirepass`) you will
need to run the Redis command `AUTH your_redis_password` prior to
running `FLUSHALL`._

~~~ shell
redis-cli
FLUSHALL
~~~

## Upgrading the Sensu package

The following instructions assume that you have already installed
Sensu and/or Sensu Enterprise by using the steps detailed in the
[Sensu Installation Guide](installation-overview).

_NOTE: If your machines do not have direct access to the internet and
cannot reach the Sensu software repositories, you must mirror the
repositories and keep them up-to-date._
