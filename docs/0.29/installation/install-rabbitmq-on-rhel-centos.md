_NOTE: this guide uses the official software repositories and packages for
Erlang and RabbitMQ, as many Linux distributions provide outdated versions that
contain known security vulnerabilities and bugs._

## Install Erlang (the RabbitMQ runtime) {#install-erlang}

RabbitMQ runs on the [Erlang runtime][1], so before you can install and run
RabbitMQ, you'll need to install Erlang.

1. Add the EPEL repository:

   ~~~
   sudo yum install epel-release
   ~~~

2. Add the Erlang Solutions YUM repository:

   ~~~ shell
   sudo wget http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
   sudo rpm -Uvh erlang-solutions-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
   ~~~

3. Install Erlang:

   ~~~
   sudo yum install -y erlang-19.0
   ~~~

## Install RabbitMQ

According to the [official RabbitMQ installation guide][2], although RabbitMQ
packages are included in the RPM-based distribution repositories, downloading
and installing RabbitMQ from the RabbitMQ website is the recommended
installation method.

> `rabbitmq-server` is included in [RPM-based distributions]. However, the
  versions included are often quite old. You will probably get better results
  installing the .rpm from our website. Check the [distribution] package details
  for which version of the server is available for which versions of the
  distribution.

[Sensu Support][3] is available for RabbitMQ versions 3.6.0 and newer ([on
Erlang version R16B03 or newer][4]).

### Download and install RabbitMQ using `rpm`

1. Download the signing key for the RabbitMQ YUM repository, and then download
   and install RabbitMQ 3.6.3 using the `rpm` utility:

   ~~~ shell
   sudo rpm --import http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
   sudo rpm -Uvh http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v3.6.3/rabbitmq-server-3.6.3-1.noarch.rpm
   ~~~

### Install RabbitMQ using YUM

The RabbitMQ website provides [instructions for installing from the official
RabbitMQ YUM repository][2].

_WARNING: this installation method is not recommended for Sensu Enterprise
users, as the repository is labeled as a "testing" repo, because (according to
the RabbitMQ website) "[they] release somewhat frequently", and there shouldn't
be a reason to upgrade RabbitMQ versions frequently._

## Managing the RabbitMQ service/process

1. Install the RabbitMQ init scripts using the [`chkconfig` utility][5]:

   ~~~ shell
   sudo chkconfig rabbitmq-server on
   ~~~

2. Start and stop the RabbitMQ service using the installed init scripts:

   _NOTE: The `service` command will not work on CentOS 5, the
   sysvinit script must be used, e.g. `sudo /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server start`_

   ~~~ shell
   sudo service rabbitmq-server start
   sudo service rabbitmq-server stop
   ~~~

## Configure RabbitMQ access controls

Access to RabbitMQ is restricted by [access controls][6] (e.g. username and
password). For Sensu services to connect to RabbitMQ a RabbitMQ virtual host
(`vhost`) and user credentials will need to be created.

### Create a dedicated RabbitMQ `vhost` for Sensu

~~~ shell
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /sensu
~~~

### Create a RabbitMQ user for Sensu

~~~ shell
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user sensu secret
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /sensu sensu ".*" ".*" ".*"
~~~

## Configure system limits on Linux

By default, most Linux operating systems will limit the maximum number of file
handles a single process is allowed to have open to `1024`. RabbitMQ recommends
adjusting this number to `65536` for production systems, and at least `4096` for
development environments.

> RabbitMQ installations running production workloads may need system limits and
  kernel parameters tuning in order to handle a decent number of concurrent
  connections and queues. The main setting that needs adjustment is the max
  number of open files, also known as `ulimit -n`. The default value on many
  operating systems is too low for a messaging broker (eg. 1024 on several Linux
  distributions). We recommend allowing for at least 65536 file descriptors for
  user `rabbitmq` in production environments. 4096 should be sufficient for most
  development workloads.
>
> There are two limits in play: the maximum number of open files the OS kernel
  allows (`fs.file-max`) and the per-user limit (`ulimit -n`). The former must be
  higher than the latter.

  _Source: [rabbitmq.com][2]_

To adjust this limit, please edit the configuration file found at
`/etc/defaults/rabbitmq-server` by uncommenting the last line in the file, and
adjusting the ulimit value to the recommendation corresponding to the
environment where RabbitMQ is running.

~~~ shell
# This file is sourced by the rabbitmq-server service script. Its primary
# reason for existing is to allow adjustment of system limits for the
# rabbitmq-server process.
#
# Maximum number of open file handles. This will need to be increased
# to handle many simultaneous connections. Refer to the system
# documentation for ulimit (in man bash) for more information.
#
ulimit -n 65536
~~~

### Verifying the Limit

To verify that the RabbitMQ open file handle limit has been increase, please
run:

~~~ shell
rabbitmqctl status
~~~

## Configure Sensu

The following Sensu configuration files are provided as examples. Please review
the [RabbitMQ reference documentation][7] for additional information on
configuring Sensu to communicate with RabbitMQ, and the [reference documentation
on Sensu configuration][8] for more information on how Sensu loads
configuration.

### Example Standalone Configuration

1. Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json`:

   ~~~ json
   {
     "rabbitmq": {
       "host": "127.0.0.1",
       "port": 5672,
       "vhost": "/sensu",
       "user": "sensu",
       "password": "secret"
     }
   }
   ~~~

### Example Distributed Configuration

1. Obtain the IP address of the system where RabbitMQ is installed. For the
   purpose of this example, we will assume `10.0.1.6` is our IP address.

2. Create a configuration file  with the following contents at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json` on the Sensu server and API system(s), and
   all systems running the Sensu client:

   ~~~ json
   {
     "rabbitmq": {
       "host": "10.0.1.6",
       "port": 5672,
       "vhost": "/sensu",
       "user": "sensu",
       "password": "secret"
     }
   }
   ~~~
