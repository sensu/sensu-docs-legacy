  - [`/clients` (GET)](#clients-get)
  - [`/clients` (POST)](#clients-post)
- [The `/clients/:client` API endpoint(s)](#the-clientsclient-api-endpoints)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The `/clients` API Endpoint

The `/clients` API endpoint provides HTTP GET and POST access to the [Sensu
client registry][1].

### `/clients` (GET)

The `/clients` endpoint provides HTTP GET access to [client registry data][1] as
published via [client keepalives][2], generated for a [proxy client][3], or
created [via HTTP POST to the `/clients` API][4].

#### EXAMPLES {#clients-get-example}

The following example demonstrates a `/clients` API query which returns a JSON
Array of JSON Hashes containing client data (i.e. the [Sensu client
registry][1]).

~~~ shell
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients | jq .
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1458625739,
    "version": "0.28.0",
    "socket": {
      "port": 3030,
      "bind": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    "subscriptions": [
      "dev"
    ],
    "environment": "development",
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "name": "client-01"
  }
]
~~~

_NOTE: for larger Sensu installations it may be undesirable to get the entire
[client registry][1] in a single API request. The `/clients` API provides
pagination controls via the [`limit` and `offset` url parameters][7] (see
below)._

#### API Specification {#clients-get-specification}

`/clients` (GET)
: desc.
  : Returns a list of clients.

      - **required**: false
      - **type**: Integer
      - **description**: The number of clients to return.
      - **example**: `http://hostname:4567/clients?limit=100`
    - `offset`
      - **required**: false
      - **type**: Integer
      - **depends**: `limit`
      - **description**: The number of clients to offset before returning items.
      - **example**: `http://hostname:4567/clients?limit=100&offset=100`

  : - **Success**: 200 (OK)
    - **Error**: 500 (Internal Server Error)

: output

    [
        {

            "subscriptions": [
                "chef-client",
                "sensu-server"
            ],
            "timestamp": 1324674972
        },
        {
            "name": "i-424242",
            "address": "192.168.0.3",
            "subscriptions": [
                "chef-client",

            ],
            "timestamp": 1324674956
        }
    ]
    ~~~

### `/clients` (POST)

The `/clients` endpoint provides HTTP POST access to the [client registry][1].

### EXAMPLES {#clients-post-example}

The following example demonstrates submitting an HTTP POST to the `/clients`
API, resulting in a [201 (Created) HTTP response code][5] (i.e.
`HTTP/1.1 201 Created`) and a JSON Hash containing the client `name`.

~~~ shell
$ curl -s -i \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"name": "api-example","address": "10.0.2.100","subscriptions":["default"],"environment":"production"}' \
http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
Content-Length: 22
Connection: keep-alive
Server: thin

{"name":"api-example"}
~~~

### API Specification {#clients-post-specification}

`/clients` (POST)
: desc
  : Create or update client data (e.g. [Sensu proxy clients][3]).

: example URL
  : http://hostname:4567/clients

: payload
  : ~~~ json
    {
        "name": "gateway-router",
        "address": "192.168.0.1",
        "subscriptions": [
            "network",
            "snmp"
        ],
        "environment": "production"
    }
    ~~~

: response codes
  : - **Success**: 201 (Created)
    - **Malformed**: 400 (Bad Request)
    - **Error**: 500 (Internal Server Error)

## The `/clients/:client` API Endpoint(s)

The `/clients/:client` API endpoint provides read and delete access to specific
Sensu client data in the [Sensu client registry][1], by client `name`.

### `/clients/:client` (GET)

The `/clients/:client` endpoint provides HTTP GET access to specific client
definitions in the [client registry][1] as published via [client keepalives][2],
generated for a [proxy  client][3], or created [via POST to the `/clients`
API][4].

### EXAMPLE {#clients-client-get-example}

In the following example, querying the `/clients/:client` API returns a JSON
Hash containing the requested `:client` data (i.e. for the client named
`client-01`).

~~~ shell
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients/client-01 | jq .
{
  "timestamp": 1458625739,
  "version": "0.28.0",
  "socket": {
    "port": 3030,
    "bind": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "subscriptions": [
    "dev"
  ],
  "environment": "development",
  "address": "127.0.0.1",
  "name": "client-01"
}
~~~

The following example demonstrates a request for client data for a non-existent
`:client` named `non-existent-client`, which results in a [404 (Not Found) HTTP
response code][5] (i.e. `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found`).

~~~ shell
$ curl -s -i http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients/non-existent-client
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

    }
    ~~~

### `/clients/:client` (DELETE)

The `/clients/:client` endpoint provides HTTP DELETE access to specific client
definitions in the [client registry][1].

#### EXAMPLE {#clientsclient-delete-example}

The following example demonstrates a request to delete a `:client` named
`api-example`, resulting in a [202 (Accepted) HTTP response code][5] (i.e.
`HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted`) and a JSON Hash containing an `issued` timestamp.

~~~ shell
$ curl -s -i -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients/api-example

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

: response codes
  : - **Success**: 202 (Accepted)
    - **Missing**: 404 (Not Found)

## The `/clients/:client/history` API Endpoint(s)

The `/clients/:client/history` API is being deprecated in favor of the [Sensu
Results API][6]. This API predates the `/results` APIs and provides less
functionality than the newer alternative.
