## Overview

The `silence_stashes` Enterprise filter is used to filter events when specific
[Sensu API stashes][1] exist. The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard and many community
tools make use of "silence stashes" to indicate Sensu clients and/or their
checks that are "silenced" or under maintenance. Events will be filtered if a
silence stash exists for the client and/or its check specified in the event
data.

## Configuration

### Example(s)

The following is an example of how to apply the `silence_stashes` enterprise
filter to a standard Sensu `pipe` handler.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "custom_mailer": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "custom_mailer.rb",
      "filter": "silence_stashes"
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Filter specification
