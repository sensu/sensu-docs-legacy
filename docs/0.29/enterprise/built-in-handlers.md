## What are built-in Handlers?

Sensu Enterprise ships with several built-in third-party integrations, which
provide Sensu [event handlers][1]. These built-in handlers can be used to handle
events for any [check][2]. The Enterprise integrations use their own global
configuration namespaces in combination with [enterprise contact routing][3] to
provide granular controls over how events should be handled in a variety of
circumstances.

## How to use built-in handlers

After configuring one or more [enterprise handlers][4], you can specify which
ones are used per check or create a default handler set to specify those used by
default.

### Examples {#example-integration-configurations}

The following is an example of how to configure a Sensu check to use the
built-in `email` integration (i.e. Enterprise handler).

`/etc/sensu/conf.d/checks/load_balancer_listeners.json`

~~~ json
{
  "checks": {
    "load_balancer_listeners": {
      "command": "check-haproxy.rb -s /var/run/haproxy.sock -A",
      "subscribers": [
        "load_balancer"
      ],
      "interval": 20,
      "handler": "email"
    }
  }
}
~~~

The following is an example of how to configure the Sensu default handler in
order to specify one or more built-in enterprise handlers. The default handler
is used when a check definition does not specify one or more event handlers.
This example specifies the built-in `email` and `slack` enterprise handlers.

`/etc/sensu/conf.d/handlers/default.json`

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "default": {
      "type": "set",
      "handlers": [
        "email",
        "slack"
      ]
    }
  }
}
