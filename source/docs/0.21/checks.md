# What are Sensu checks? {#what-are-sensu-checks}

Sensu checks allow you to monitor services or measure resources, they are executed on machines running the Sensu client. Checks are essentially commands (or scripts) that output data to `STDOUT` or `STDERR` and produce an exit status code to indicate a state. Common exit status codes used are `0` for `OK`, `1` for `WARNING`, `2` for `CRITICAL`, and `3` or greater to indicate `UNKNOWN` or `CUSTOM`. Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios, therefore, Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu.

## Example check plugin {#example-check-plugin}

The following is an example Sensu check plugin, a script located at `/etc/sensu/plugins/check-chef-client.rb`. This check plugin uses the running process list to determine if the Chef client process is running. This check plugin is written in Ruby, but Sensu plugins can be written in any language, e.g. Python, shell, etc.

~~~ ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# get the current list of processes
processes = `ps aux`

# determine if the chef-client process is running
running = processes.lines.detect do |process|
  process.include?('chef-client')
end

# return appropriate check output and exit status code
if running
  puts 'OK - Chef client process is running'
  exit 0
else
  puts 'WARNING - Chef client process is NOT running'
  exit 1
end
~~~

# Check definition

A Sensu check definition is a JSON configuration file describing a Sensu check. A definition declares how a Sensu check is executed:

- The command to run (e.g. script)
- How frequently it should be executed (interval)
- Where it should be executed (which machines)

## Example check definition {#example-check-definition}

The following is an example Sensu check definition, a JSON configuration file located at `/etc/sensu/conf.d/check_chef_client.json`. This check definition uses the [example check plugin](#example-check-plugin) above, to determine if the Chef client process is running. The check is named `chef_client` and it runs `/etc/sensu/plugins/check-chef-client.rb` on Sensu clients with the `production` subscription, every `60` seconds (interval).

~~~ json
{
  "checks": {
    "chef_client": {
      "command": "/etc/sensu/plugins/check-chef-client.rb",
      "subscribers": [
        "production"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}

# Anatomy of a check definition

### Name

Each check definition has a unique check name, used for the definition key. Every check definition is within the `"checks": {}` definition scope.

- A unique string used to name/identify the check
- Cannot contain special characters or spaces
- Validated with `/^[\w\.-]+$/`
- e.g. `"chef_client": {}`

### Definition attributes

type
: description
  : The check type, either `standard` or `metric`. Setting type to `metric` will cause OK (exit 0) check results to create events.
: required
  : false
: type
  : String
: allowed values
  : `standard`, `metric`
: default
  : `standard`
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "type": "metric"
    ~~~

command
: description
  : The check command to be executed.
: required
  : true (unless `extension` is configured)
: type
  : String
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "command": "/etc/sensu/plugins/check-chef-client.rb"
    ~~~

extension
: description
  : The name of a Sensu check extension to run instead of a command. This is an _advanced feature_ and is not commonly used.
: required
  : true (unless `command` is configured)
: type
  : String
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "extension": "system_profile"
    ~~~

standalone
: description
  : If the check is scheduled by the local Sensu client instead of the Sensu server (standalone mode).
: required
  : false
: type
  : Boolean
: default
  : false
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "standalone": true
    ~~~

subscribers
: description
  : An array of Sensu client subscriptions that check requests will be sent to. The array cannot be empty and its items must each be a string.
: required
  : true (unless `standalone` is `true`)
: type
  : Array
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "subscribers": ["production"]
    ~~~

publish
: description
  : If check requests are published for the check.
: required
  : false
: type
  : Boolean
: default
  : true
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "publish": false
    ~~~

interval
: description
  : The frequency in seconds the check is executed.
: required
  : true (unless `publish` is `false`)
: type
  : Integer
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "interval": 60
    ~~~

timeout
: description
  : The check execution duration timeout in seconds (hard stop).
: required
  : false
: type
  : Integer
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "timeout": 30
    ~~~

ttl
: description
  : The time to live (TTL) in seconds until check results are considered stale. If a client stops publishing results for the check, and the TTL expires, an event will be created for the client. The check `ttl` must be greater than the check `interval`, and should accomodate time for the check execution and result processing to complete. For example, if a check has an `interval` of `60` (seconds) and a `timeout` of `30` (seconds), an appropriate `ttl` would be a minimum of `90` (seconds).
: required
  : false
: type
  : Integer
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "ttl": 100
    ~~~

auto_resolve
: description
  : When a check in a `WARNING` or `CRITICAL` state begins returning an `OK` state, the event generated by the `WARNING` or `CRITICAL` state will be automatically resolved. Setting `auto_resolve` to `true` will prevent this automatic event resolution from occurring. This is useful in situations where you explicitly want to manually resolve an event, such as via the API or a dashboard.

# Custom definition attributes

Custom check definition attributes may be included to add additional information (context) about the Sensu check. Custom check attributes will be included in [event data](events). Some great example use cases for custom check definition attributes are contact routing, documentation links, and metric graph image URLs.

The following is an example Sensu check definition that a custom definition attribute, `"playbook"`, a URL for documentation to aid in the resolution of events for the check. The playbook URL will be available in [event data](events) and thus able to be included in event notifications (e.g. email).

~~~ json
{
  "checks": {
    "check_mysql_replication": {
      "command": "check-mysql-replication-status.rb --user sensu --password secret",
      "subscribers": [
        "mysql"
      ],
      "interval": 30,
      "playbook": "http://docs.example.com/wiki/mysql-replication-playbook"
    }
  }
}

# Sensu plugin attributes

The [Sensu plugin project](https://github.com/sensu-plugins) provides a Ruby library ([sensu-plugin](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugin/)) to help Sensu plugin authors and offer users a variety of features. The sensu-plugin features make use of select custom check definition attributes. When using a [Sensu event handler](handlers) that makes use of the sensu-plugin library, you can configure the following attributes in any check definition.

occurrences
: description
  : The number of event occurrences that must occur before an event is handled for the check.
: required
  : false
: type
  : Integer
: default
  : `1`
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "occurrences": 3
    ~~~

refresh
: description
  : Time in seconds until the event occurrence count is considered reset for the purpose of counting `occurrences`, to allow an event for the check to be handled again. For example, a check with a refresh of `1800` will have its events (recurrences) handled every 30 minutes, to remind users of the issue.
: required
  : false
: type
  : Integer
: default
  : `1800`
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "refresh": 3600
    ~~~

dependencies
: description
  : An array of check dependencies. Events for the check will not be handled if events exist for one or more of the check dependencies. A check dependency can be a check executed by the same Sensu client (eg. `check_app`), or a client/check pair (eg.`db-01/check_mysql`).
: required
  : false
: type
  : Array
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "dependencies": [
      "check_app",
      "db-01/check_mysql"
    ]
    ~~~

notification
: description
  : The notification message used for events created by the check, instead of the commonly used check output. This attribute is used by most notification event handlers that use the sensu-plugin library.
: required
  : false
: type
  : String
: example
  : ~~~ shell
    "notification": "the shopping cart application is not responding to requests"
    ~~~

# Check command tokens

Sensu check plugins may use command line arguments for execution options, such as thresholds, file paths, URls, and credentials. In some cases, the command line arguments may need to differ per client in a Sensu [client subscription](clients#client-subscriptions). Sensu check command tokens, a pattern containing a dot notation client attribute key (e.g. `:::disk.warning:::`), are substituted by the client attribute value before the command is executed by the Sensu client. Command tokens allow the check command to be customized by the Sensu client definition attributes at execution time. Sensu check command tokens may provide a default value, separated by a `|` character, for clients executing the check that do not have the matching client definition attribute (e.g. `:::disk.warning|2GB:::`). If a command token does not provide a default value, and the client does not have the definition attribute, a check result indicating unmatched tokens will be published for the check execution, e.g. `"Unmatched command tokens: disk.warning"`.

## Example check command tokens

The following is an example Sensu check definition, a JSON configuration file located at `/etc/sensu/conf.d/check_disk_usage.json`. This check definition makes use of Sensu check command tokens. The check is named `check_disk_usage` and it runs `check-disk-usage.rb` with client specific thresholds on Sensu clients with the `production` subscription, every `60` seconds.

~~~ json
{
  "checks": {
    "check_disk_usage": {
      "command": "check-disk-usage.rb -w :::disk.warning|90::: -c :::disk.critical|95:::",
      "subscribers": [
        "production"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
~~~

The following is an example Sensu client definition, containing the custom attributes used by the above check for disk usage thresholds.

~~~ json
{
  "client": {
    "name": "i-424242",
    "address": "8.8.8.8",
    "subscriptions": [
      "production",
      "webserver",
      "mysql"
    ],
    "disk": {
      "warning": 97,
      "critical": 99
    }
  }
}
~~~
