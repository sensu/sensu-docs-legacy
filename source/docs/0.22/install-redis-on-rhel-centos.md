## Install Redis from the EPEL repositories

Because Redis is not available by default in all RHEL and CentOS distribution
repositories, you will need to install the corresponding [EPEL][1] repository
[for your CentOS/RHEL release][2] (supported platforms are RHEL 5, RHEL 6, and
RHEL 7).

1. Install EPEL on RHEL/CentOS 6:

   ~~~ shell
   sudo rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
   ~~~

   _NOTE: the preceding command will install the EPEL repository for
   RHEL/CentOS **version 6 ONLY**. For other RHEL/CentOS releases (i.e. version
   5 or 7), please refer to the [intructions for installing the correct EPEL for
   your release][2]._

2. Install Redis using YUM

   Install Redis (>= 1.3.14) from the EPEL repository:

   ~~~ shell
   sudo yum install redis
   ~~~

## Managing the Redis service/process

Install the Redis init scripts using the [`chkconfig` utility][3]:

~~~ shell
sudo /sbin/chkconfig redis on
sudo /etc/init.d/redis start
~~~

## Verify that Redis is working

Once you have installed and started the Redis service, you should be able to
confirm that Redis is ready to use by running the command:  <kbd>redis-cli
ping</kbd>. If you get a `PONG` response, you are ready to move on to the next
step in the guide.

## Configure Sensu

The following Sensu configuration files are provided as examples. Please review
the [Redis reference documentation][4] for additional information on configuring
Sensu to communicate with Redis, and the [reference documentation on Sensu
configuration][5] for more information on how Sensu loads configuration.

### Example Standalone Configuration

1. Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/redis.json`:

   ~~~ json
   {
     "redis": {
       "host": "localhost",
       "port": 6379
     }
   }
   ~~~

### Example Distributed Configuration

1. Obtain the IP address of the system where Redis is installed. For the purpose
   of this guide, we will use `10.0.1.5` as our example IP address.

2. Create a configuration file  with the following contents at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/redis.json` on the Sensu server and API system(s), and all
   systems running the Sensu client:

   ~~~ json
   {
     "redis": {
       "host": "10.0.1.5",
       "port": 6379,
       "auto_reconnect": true
     }
   }
   ~~~

   _NOTE: the `sensu-client` process does not require Redis configuration
   unless Redis is being used as the [Sensu Transport][6]. If you're not
   planning on using Redis as the Sensu Transport, you do not needÂ to create a
   Redis configuration file on systems where the Sensu client is installed._

### Using Redis as the Sensu Transport

1. If you are [planning to use Redis][7] as your [Sensu Transport][6], please
   copy the following contents to a configuration file located at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/transport.json`:

   ~~~ json
   {
     "transport": {
       "name": "redis",
       "reconnect_on_error": true
     }
   }
   ~~~

   This will inform the Sensu services to use the defined Redis configuration as
   the Sensu Transport (instead of looking for the default transport, RabbitMQ).
