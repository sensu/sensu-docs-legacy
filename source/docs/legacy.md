# Legacy Documentation

Documentation for Sensu versions released **before January 1, 2015** is no
longer being hosted on the Sensu website. Unless you are looking for legacy
Sensu documentation on purpose, please refer to the documentation for the
[latest release](/docs/latest/overview). To access legacy Sensu documentation,
please visit the [sensu-docs](http://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs) project on
GitHub.
